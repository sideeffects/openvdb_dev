    Improvements:
    - Significant performance improvements to tools::activate and
      tools::deactivate through use of the DynamicNodeManager to parallelize
      tile processing.

    Bug fixes:
    - tools::deactivate now also works with a MaskTree.

    API changes:
    - Added ability to run tools::activate and tools::deactivate
      single-threaded.

    Houdini:
    - VDB Activate SOP now uses the multi-threaded tools::deactivate for much
      faster performance.
